<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Miss Morland, I think very highly of the understanding of all the women in the world&mdash;especially of those&mdash;whoever they may be&mdash;with whom I happen to be in company.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is not enough. Be more serious.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Miss Morland, no one can think more highly of the understanding of women than I do. In my opinion, nature has given them so much that they never find it necessary to use more than half.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We shall get nothing more serious from him now, Miss Morland. He is not in a sober mood. But I do assure you that he must be entirely misunderstood, if he can ever appear to say an unjust thing of any woman at all, or an unkind one of me.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
