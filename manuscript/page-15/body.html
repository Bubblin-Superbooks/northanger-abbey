<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> A family of ten children will be always called a fine family, where there are heads and arms and legs enough for the number; but the Morlands had little other right to the word, for they were in general very plain, and Catherine, for many years of her life, as plain as any. She had a thin awkward figure, a sallow skin without colour, dark lank hair, and strong features&mdash;so much for her person; and not less unpropitious for heroism seemed her mind. She was fond of all boy&rsquo;s plays, and greatly preferred cricket not merely to dolls, but to the more heroic enjoyments of infancy, nursing a dormouse, feeding a canary-bird, or watering a rose-bush. Indeed she had no taste for a garden; and if she gathered flowers at all, it was chiefly for the pleasure of mischief&mdash;at least so it was conjectured from her always preferring those which she was forbidden to take.</p></div> </div>
