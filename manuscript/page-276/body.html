<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;A particular friend of mine had an account of it in a letter from London yesterday. It is to be uncommonly dreadful. I shall expect murder and everything of the kind.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You speak with astonishing composure! But I hope your friend&rsquo;s accounts have been exaggerated; and if such a design is known beforehand, proper measures will undoubtedly be taken by government to prevent its coming to effect.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Government,&rdquo; said Henry, endeavouring not to smile, &ldquo;neither desires nor dares to interfere in such matters. There must be murder; and government cares not how much.&rdquo;</p><p>The ladies stared. He laughed, and added, &ldquo;Come, shall I make you understand each other, or leave you to puzzle out an explanation as you can? No&mdash;I will be noble. I will prove myself a man, no less by the generosity of my soul than the clearness of my head.</p></div> </div>
