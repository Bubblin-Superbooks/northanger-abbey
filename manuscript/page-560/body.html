<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Let me have the satisfaction of knowing that you are safe at Fullerton, and have found your family well, and then, till I can ask for your correspondence as I ought to do, I will not expect more. Direct to me at Lord Longtown&rsquo;s, and, I must ask it, under cover to Alice.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, Eleanor, if you are not allowed to receive a letter from me, I am sure I had better not write. There can be no doubt of my getting home safe.&rdquo;</p><p>Eleanor only replied, &ldquo;I cannot wonder at your feelings. I will not importune you. I will trust to your own kindness of heart when I am at a distance from you.&rdquo; But this, with the look of sorrow accompanying it, was enough to melt Catherine&rsquo;s pride in a moment, and she instantly said, &ldquo;Oh, Eleanor, I will write to you indeed.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
