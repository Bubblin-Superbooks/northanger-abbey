<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;And yet I have heard that there is a great deal of wine drunk in Oxford.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oxford! There is no drinking at Oxford now, I assure you. Nobody drinks there. You would hardly meet with a man who goes beyond his four pints at the utmost. Now, for instance, it was reckoned a remarkable thing, at the last party in my rooms, that upon an average we cleared about five pints a head. It was looked upon as something out of the common way. Mine is famous good stuff, to be sure. You would not often meet with anything like it in Oxford&mdash;and that may account for it. But this will just give you a notion of the general rate of drinking there.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
