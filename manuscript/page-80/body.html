How much I am obliged to you; and when you have finished Udolpho, we will read the Italian together; and I have made out a list of ten or twelve more of the same kind for you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Have you, indeed! How glad I am! What are they all?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I will read you their names directly; here they are, in my pocketbook. Castle of Wolfenbach, Clermont, Mysterious Warnings, Necromancer of the Black Forest, Midnight Bell, Orphan of the Rhine, and Horrid Mysteries. Those will last us some time.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, pretty well; but are they all horrid, are you sure they are all horrid?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
