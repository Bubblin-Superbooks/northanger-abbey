The wheels have been fairly worn out these ten years at least&mdash;and as for the body! Upon my soul, you might shake it to pieces yourself with a touch. It is the most devilish little rickety business I ever beheld! Thank God! we have got a better. I would not be bound to go two miles in it for fifty thousand pounds.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Good heavens!&rdquo; cried Catherine, quite frightened. &ldquo;Then pray let us turn back; they will certainly meet with an accident if we go on. Do let us turn back, Mr. Thorpe; stop and speak to my brother, and tell him how very unsafe it is.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
