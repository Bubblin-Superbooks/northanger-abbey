A very fine fellow; as rich as a Jew. I should like to dine with him; I dare say he gives famous dinners. But what do you think we have been talking of? You. Yes, by heavens! And the general thinks you the finest girl in Bath.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh! Nonsense! How can you say so?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
