I see that she has had designs on Captain Tilney, which have not succeeded; but I do not understand what Captain Tilney has been about all this time. Why should he pay her such attentions as to make her quarrel with my brother, and then fly off himself?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I have very little to say for Frederick&rsquo;s motives, such as I believe them to have been.

If the effect of his behaviour does not justify him with you, we had better not seek after the cause.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
