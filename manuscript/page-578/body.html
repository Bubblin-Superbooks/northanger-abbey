<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>a letter which Eleanor might not be pained by the perusal of&mdash;and, above all, which she might not blush herself, if Henry should chance to see, was an undertaking to frighten away all her powers of performance; and, after long thought and much perplexity, to be very brief was all that she could determine on with any confidence of safety. The money therefore which Eleanor had advanced was enclosed with little more than grateful thanks, and the thousand good wishes of a most affectionate heart.</p><p>&ldquo;This has been a strange acquaintance,&rdquo; observed Mrs. Morland, as the letter was finished; &ldquo;soon made and soon ended. I am sorry it happens so, for Mrs. Allen thought them very pretty kind of young people; and you were sadly out of luck too in your Isabella. Ah! Poor James! Well, we must live and learn; and the next new friends you make I hope will be better worth keeping.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
