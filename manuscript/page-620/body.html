<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Northanger Abbey was written in 1797-98 under a different title. The manuscript was revised around 1803 and sold to a London publisher, Crosbie & Co., who sold it back in 1816. The Signet Classic text is based on the first edition, published by John Murray, London, in 1818&mdash;the year following Miss Austen&rsquo;s death. Spelling and punctuation have been largely brought into conformity with modern British usage.</p></div> </div>
