I wish we had a large acquaintance here.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I wish we had any&mdash;it would be somebody to go to.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Very true, my dear; and if we knew anybody we would join them directly. The Skinners were here last year&mdash;I wish they were here now.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Had not we better go away as it is? Here are no tea-things for us, you see.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No more there are, indeed. How very provoking! But I think we had better sit still, for one gets so tumbled in such a crowd! How is my head, my dear? Somebody gave me a push that has hurt it, I am afraid.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
