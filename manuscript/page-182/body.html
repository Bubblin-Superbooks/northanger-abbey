People that marry can never part, but must go and keep house together. People that dance only stand opposite each other in a long room for half an hour.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And such is your definition of matrimony and dancing. Taken in that light certainly, their resemblance is not striking; but I think I could place them in such a view. You will allow, that in both, man has the advantage of choice, woman only the power of refusal; that in both, it is an engagement between man and woman, formed for the advantage of each;</p></div> </div>
