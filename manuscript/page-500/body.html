And yet, when we talked about it in Bath, you little thought of its ending so. Isabella&mdash;no wonder now I have not heard from her&mdash;Isabella has deserted my brother, and is to marry yours! Could you have believed there had been such inconstancy and fickleness, and everything that is bad in the world?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I hope, so far as concerns my brother, you are misinformed. I hope he has not had any material share in bringing on Mr. Morland&rsquo;s disappointment. His marrying Miss Thorpe is not probable. I think you must be deceived so far.</p></div> </div>
