<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> You really have done your hair in a more heavenly style than ever; you mischievous creature, do you want to attract everybody? I assure you, my brother is quite in love with you already; and as for Mr. Tilney&mdash;but that is a settled thing&mdash;even your modesty cannot doubt his attachment now; his coming back to Bath makes it too plain. Oh! What would not I give to see him! I really am quite wild with impatience. My mother says he is the most delightful young man in the world; she saw him this morning, you know; you must introduce him to me. Is he in the house now? Look about, for heaven&rsquo;s sake! I assure you, I can hardly exist till I see him.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Catherine, &ldquo;he is not here; I cannot see him anywhere.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
