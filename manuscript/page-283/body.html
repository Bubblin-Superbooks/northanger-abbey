I think you and I are very well off to be out of the scrape. It must be the dullest thing in the world, for there is not a soul at Clifton at this time of year. Belle went with your brother, and John drove Maria.&rdquo;</p><p>Catherine spoke the pleasure she really felt on hearing this part of the arrangement.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh! yes,&rdquo; rejoined the other, &ldquo;Maria is gone. She was quite wild to go. She thought it would be something very fine.
