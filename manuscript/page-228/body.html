<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Is there a Henry in the world who could be insensible to such a declaration? Henry Tilney at least was not. With a yet sweeter smile, he said everything that need be said of his sister&rsquo;s concern, regret, and dependence on Catherine&rsquo;s honour. &ldquo;Oh! Do not say Miss Tilney was not angry,&rdquo; cried Catherine, &ldquo;because I know she was; for she would not see me this morning when I called; I saw her walk out of the house the next minute after my leaving it; I was hurt, but I was not affronted. Perhaps you did not know I had been there.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I was not within at the time; but I heard of it from Eleanor, and she has been wishing ever since to see you, to explain the reason of such incivility; but perhaps I can do it as well.</p></div> </div>
