<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> My mother&rsquo;s room is very commodious, is it not? Large and cheerful-looking, and the dressing-closets so well disposed!

After a short silence, during which he had closely observed her, he added, &ldquo;As there is nothing in the room in itself to raise curiosity, this must have proceeded from a sentiment of respect for my mother&rsquo;s character, as described by Eleanor, which does honour to her memory. The world, I believe, never saw a better woman. But it is not often that virtue can boast an interest such as this.</p></div> </div>
