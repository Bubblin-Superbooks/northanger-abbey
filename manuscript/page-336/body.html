<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I was just beginning to make the request, sir, as you came in.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, proceed by all means. I know how much your heart is in it. My daughter, Miss Morland,&rdquo; he continued, without leaving his daughter time to speak, &ldquo;has been forming a very bold wish. We leave Bath, as she has perhaps told you, on Saturday se&rsquo;nnight. A letter from my steward tells me that my presence is wanted at home; and being disappointed in my hope of seeing the Marquis of Longtown and General Courteney here, some of my very old friends, there is nothing to detain me longer in Bath. And could we carry our selfish point with you, we should leave it without a single regret. Can you, in short, be prevailed on to quit this scene of public triumph and oblige your friend Eleanor with your company in Gloucestershire?</p></div> </div>
