<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>After half an hour&rsquo;s free indulgence of grief and reflection, Catherine felt equal to encountering her friends; but whether she should make her distress known to them was another consideration. Perhaps, if particularly questioned, she might just give an idea&mdash;just distantly hint at it&mdash;but not more.

Henry and Eleanor were by themselves in the breakfast-room; and each, as she entered it, looked at her anxiously.

Mr. and Mrs. Morland&mdash;your brothers and sisters&mdash;I hope they are none of them ill?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
