<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> &ldquo;It is very true, upon my honour, but I see how it is; you are indifferent to everybody&rsquo;s admiration, except that of one gentleman, who shall be nameless. Nay, I cannot blame you&rdquo;&mdash;speaking more seriously&mdash;&ldquo;your feelings are easily understood. Where the heart is really attached, I know very well how little one can be pleased with the attention of anybody else. Everything is so insipid, so uninteresting, that does not relate to the beloved object! I can perfectly comprehend your feelings.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But you should not persuade me that I think so very much about Mr. Tilney, for perhaps I may never see him again.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
