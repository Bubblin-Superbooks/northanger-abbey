Her heart was overflowing with tenderness. It was &ldquo;dear John&rdquo; and &ldquo;dear Catherine&rdquo; at every word; &ldquo;dear Anne and dear Maria&rdquo; must immediately be made sharers in their felicity; and two &ldquo;dears&rdquo; at once before the name of Isabella were not more than that beloved child had now well earned.
