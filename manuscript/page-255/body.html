I cannot bear to see it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Dear madam,&rdquo; cried Catherine, &ldquo;then why did not you tell me so before? I am sure if I had known it to be improper, I would not have gone with Mr. Thorpe at all; but I always hoped you would tell me, if you thought I was doing wrong.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And so I should, my dear, you may depend on it; for as I told Mrs. Morland at parting, I would always do the best for you in my power. But one must not be over particular. Young people will be young people, as your good mother says herself. You know I wanted you, when we first came, not to buy that sprigged muslin, but you would. Young people do not like to be always thwarted.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
