Thorpe talked to his horse, and she meditated, by turns, on broken promises and broken arches, phaetons and false hangings, Tilneys and trap-doors. As they entered Argyle Buildings, however, she was roused by this address from her companion, &ldquo;Who is that girl who looked at you so hard as she went by?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Who? Where?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;On the right-hand pavement&mdash;she must be almost out of sight now.&rdquo; Catherine looked round and saw Miss Tilney leaning on her brother&rsquo;s arm, walking slowly down the street. She saw them both looking back at her. &ldquo;Stop, stop, Mr. Thorpe,&rdquo; she impatiently cried; &ldquo;it is Miss Tilney; it is indeed. How could you tell me they were gone? Stop, stop, I will get out this moment and go to them.</p></div> </div>
