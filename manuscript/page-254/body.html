Do not you think these kind of projects objectionable?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, very much so indeed. Open carriages are nasty things. A clean gown is not five minutes&rsquo; wear in them. You are splashed getting in and getting out; and the wind takes your hair and your bonnet in every direction. I hate an open carriage myself.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know you do; but that is not the question. Do not you think it has an odd appearance, if young ladies are frequently driven about in them by young men, to whom they are not even related?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
