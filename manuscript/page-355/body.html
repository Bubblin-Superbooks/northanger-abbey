<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Psha, nonsense!&rdquo; was Isabella&rsquo;s answer in the same half whisper. &ldquo;Why do you put such things into my head? If I could believe it&mdash;my spirit, you know, is pretty independent.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I wish your heart were independent. That would be enough for me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;My heart, indeed! What can you have to do with hearts? You men have none of you any hearts.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If we have not hearts, we have eyes; and they give us torment enough.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do they? I am sorry for it; I am sorry they find anything so disagreeable in me. I will look another way. I hope this pleases you&rdquo; (turning her back on him); &ldquo;I hope your eyes are not tormented now.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
