<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Catherine took up her work directly, saying, in a dejected voice, that &ldquo;her head did not run upon Bath&mdash;much.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then you are fretting about General Tilney, and that is very simple of you; for ten to one whether you ever see him again. You should never fret about trifles.&rdquo; After a short silence&mdash;&ldquo;I hope, my Catherine, you are not getting out of humour with home because it is not so grand as Northanger. That would be turning your visit into an evil indeed. Wherever you are you should always be contented, but especially at home, because there you must spend the most of your time. I did not quite like, at breakfast, to hear you talk so much about the French bread at Northanger.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
