I am sure you would be miserable if you thought so!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, indeed, I should not. I do not pretend to say that I was not very much pleased with him; but while I have Udolpho to read, I feel as if nobody could make me miserable. Oh! The dreadful black veil! My dear Isabella, I am sure there must be Laurentina&rsquo;s skeleton behind it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It is so odd to me, that you should never have read Udolpho before; but I suppose Mrs. Morland objects to novels.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, she does not. She very often reads Sir Charles Grandison herself; but new books do not fall in our way.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
