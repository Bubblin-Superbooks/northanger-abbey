Do you find Bath as agreeable as when I had the honour of making the inquiry before?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, quite&mdash;more so, indeed.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;More so! Take care, or you will forget to be tired of it at the proper time. You ought to be tired at the end of six weeks.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I do not think I should be tired, if I were to stay here six months.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Bath, compared with London, has little variety, and so everybody finds out every year. &lsquo;For six weeks, I allow Bath is pleasant enough; but beyond that, it is the most tiresome place in the world.&rsquo; You would be told so by people of all descriptions, who come regularly every winter, lengthen their six weeks into ten or twelve, and go away at last because they can afford to stay no longer.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
