Instead of finding herself improved in acquaintance with Miss Tilney, from the intercourse of the day, she seemed hardly so intimate with her as before; instead of seeing Henry Tilney to greater advantage than ever, in the ease of a family party, he had never said so little, nor been so little agreeable; and, in spite of their father&rsquo;s great civilities to her&mdash;in spite of his thanks, invitations, and compliments&mdash;</p></div> </div>
