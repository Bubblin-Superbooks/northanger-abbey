<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;As far as I have had opportunity of judging, it appears to me that the usual style of letter-writing among women is faultless, except in three particulars.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And what are they?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A general deficiency of subject, a total inattention to stops, and a very frequent ignorance of grammar.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Upon my word! I need not have been afraid of disclaiming the compliment. You do not think too highly of us in that way.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I should no more lay it down as a general rule that women write better letters than men, than that they sing better duets, or draw better landscapes. In every power, of which taste is the foundation, excellence is pretty fairly divided between the sexes.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
