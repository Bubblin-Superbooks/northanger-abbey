They live at Putney.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Are they a wealthy family?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, not very. I do not believe Isabella has any fortune at all: but that will not signify in your family. Your father is so very liberal! He told me the other day that he only valued money as it allowed him to promote the happiness of his children.&rdquo; The brother and sister looked at each other. &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Eleanor, after a short pause, &ldquo;would it be to promote his happiness, to enable him to marry such a girl? She must be an unprincipled one, or she could not have used your brother so. And how strange an infatuation on Frederick&rsquo;s side! A girl who, before his eyes, is violating an engagement voluntarily entered into with another man! Is not it inconceivable, Henry? Frederick too, who always wore his heart so proudly! Who found no woman good enough to be loved!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
