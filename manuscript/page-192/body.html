<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>In chatting with Miss Tilney before the evening concluded, a new source of felicity arose to her. She had never taken a country walk since her arrival in Bath. Miss Tilney, to whom all the commonly frequented environs were familiar, spoke of them in terms which made her all eagerness to know them too; and on her openly fearing that she might find nobody to go with her, it was proposed by the brother and sister that they should join in a walk, some morning or other. &ldquo;I shall like it,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;beyond anything in the world; and do not let us put it off&mdash;let us go tomorrow.&rdquo; This was readily agreed to, with only a proviso of Miss Tilney&rsquo;s, that it did not rain, which Catherine was sure it would not. At twelve o&rsquo;clock, they were to call for her in Pulteney Street; and &ldquo;Remember&mdash;twelve o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; was her parting speech to her new friend.</p></div> </div>
