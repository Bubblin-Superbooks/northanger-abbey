<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The following conversation, which took place between the two friends in the pump-room one morning, after an acquaintance of eight or nine days, is given as a specimen of their very warm attachment, and of the delicacy, discretion, originality of thought, and literary taste which marked the reasonableness of that attachment.</p><p>They met by appointment; and as Isabella had arrived nearly five minutes before her friend, her first address naturally was, &ldquo;My dearest creature, what can have made you so late? I have been waiting for you at least this age!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Have you, indeed! I am very sorry for it; but really I thought I was in very good time. It is but just one. I hope you have not been here long?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
