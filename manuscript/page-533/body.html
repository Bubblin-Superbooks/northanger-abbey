No, James should never hear Isabella&rsquo;s name mentioned by her again.&rdquo;</p><p>On Henry&rsquo;s arrival from Woodston, she made known to him and Eleanor their brother&rsquo;s safety, congratulating them with sincerity on it, and reading aloud the most material passages of her letter with strong indignation. When she had finished it&mdash;&ldquo;So much for Isabella,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;and for all our intimacy! She must think me an idiot, or she could not have written so; but perhaps this has served to make her character better known to me than mine is to her. I see what she has been about. She is a vain coquette, and her tricks have not answered. I do not believe she had ever any regard either for James or for me, and I wish I had never known her.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
