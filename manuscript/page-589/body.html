<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>For two days Mrs. Morland allowed it to pass even without a hint; but when a third night&rsquo;s rest had neither restored her cheerfulness, improved her in useful activity, nor given her a greater inclination for needlework, she could no longer refrain from the gentle reproof of, &ldquo;My dear Catherine, I am afraid you are growing quite a fine lady. I do not know when poor Richard&rsquo;s cravats would be done, if he had no friend but you. Your head runs too much upon Bath; but there is a time for everything&mdash;a time for balls and plays, and a time for work. You have had a long run of amusement, and now you must try to be useful.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
