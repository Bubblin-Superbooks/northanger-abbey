<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Signify! Oh, heavens! I make it a rule never to mind what they say. They are very often amazingly impertinent if you do not treat them with spirit, and make them keep their distance.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Are they? Well, I never observed that. They always behave very well to me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh! They give themselves such airs. They are the most conceited creatures in the world, and think themselves of so much importance! By the by, though I have thought of it a hundred times, I have always forgot to ask you what is your favourite complexion in a man. Do you like them best dark or fair?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I hardly know. I never much thought about it. Something between both, I think. Brown&mdash;not fair, and&mdash;and not very dark.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
