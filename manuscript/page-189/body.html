However, when you sink into this abyss again, you will have more to say. You will be able to talk of Bath, and of all that you did here.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh! Yes. I shall never be in want of something to talk of again to Mrs. Allen, or anybody else. I really believe I shall always be talking of Bath, when I am at home again&mdash;I do like it so very much. If I could but have Papa and Mamma, and the rest of them here, I suppose I should be too happy! James&rsquo;s coming (my eldest brother) is quite delightful&mdash;and especially as it turns out that the very family we are just got so intimate with are his intimate friends already. Oh! Who can ever be tired of Bath?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
