Then why does he stay here?&rdquo;</p><p>He made no reply, and was beginning to talk of something else; but she eagerly continued, &ldquo;Why do not you persuade him to go away? The longer he stays, the worse it will be for him at last. Pray advise him for his own sake, and for everybody&rsquo;s sake, to leave Bath directly. Absence will in time make him comfortable again; but he can have no hope here, and it is only staying to be miserable.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
