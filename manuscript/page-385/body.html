<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Can you stand such a ceremony as this? Will not your mind misgive you when you find yourself in this gloomy chamber&mdash;too lofty and extensive for you, with only the feeble rays of a single lamp to take in its size&mdash;its walls hung with tapestry exhibiting figures as large as life, and the bed, of dark green stuff or purple velvet, presenting even a funereal appearance? Will not your heart sink within you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh! But this will not happen to me, I am sure.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How fearfully will you examine the furniture of your apartment! And what will you discern? Not tables, toilettes, wardrobes, or drawers, but on one side perhaps the remains of a broken lute, on the other a ponderous chest which no efforts can open, and over the fireplace the portrait of some handsome warrior, whose features will so incomprehensibly strike you, that you will not be able to withdraw your eyes from it.</p></div> </div>
