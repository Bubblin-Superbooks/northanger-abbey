<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Did you see anybody else of our acquaintance?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes; we agreed to take a turn in the Crescent, and there we met Mrs. Hughes, and Mr. and Miss Tilney walking with her.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Did you indeed? And did they speak to you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, we walked along the Crescent together for half an hour. They seem very agreeable people. Miss Tilney was in a very pretty spotted muslin, and I fancy, by what I can learn, that she always dresses very handsomely. Mrs. Hughes talked to me a great deal about the family.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And what did she tell you of them?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
