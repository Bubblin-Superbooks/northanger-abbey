<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;My own disappointment and loss in her is very great; but, as for poor James, I suppose he will hardly ever recover it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Your brother is certainly very much to be pitied at present; but we must not, in our concern for his sufferings, undervalue yours. You feel, I suppose, that in losing Isabella, you lose half yourself: you feel a void in your heart which nothing else can occupy. Society is becoming irksome; and as for the amusements in which you were wont to share at Bath, the very idea of them without her is abhorrent. You would not, for instance, now go to a ball for the world. You feel that you have no longer any friend to whom you can speak with unreserve, on whose regard you can place dependence, or whose counsel, in any difficulty, you could rely on. You feel all this?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
