<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> We are going to Lord Longtown&rsquo;s, near Hereford, for a fortnight. Explanation and apology are equally impossible. I cannot attempt either.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;My dear Eleanor,&rdquo; cried Catherine, suppressing her feelings as well as she could, &ldquo;do not be so distressed. A second engagement must give way to a first. I am very, very sorry we are to part&mdash;so soon, and so suddenly too; but I am not offended, indeed I am not. I can finish my visit here, you know, at any time; or I hope you will come to me. Can you, when you return from this lord&rsquo;s, come to Fullerton?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It will not be in my power, Catherine.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
