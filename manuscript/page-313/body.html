<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Such insolence of behaviour as Miss Tilney&rsquo;s she had never heard of in her life! Not to do the honours of her house with common good breeding! To behave to her guest with such superciliousness! Hardly even to speak to her!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But it was not so bad as that, Isabella; there was no superciliousness; she was very civil.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh! Don&rsquo;t defend her! And then the brother, he, who had appeared so attached to you! Good heavens! Well, some people&rsquo;s feelings are incomprehensible. And so he hardly looked once at you the whole day?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I do not say so; but he did not seem in good spirits.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
