It was eleven, upon my soul! I counted every stroke. This brother of yours would persuade me out of my senses, Miss Morland; do but look at my horse; did you ever see an animal so made for speed in your life?&rdquo; (The servant had just mounted the carriage and was driving off.) &ldquo;Such true blood! Three hours and and a half indeed coming only three and twenty miles! Look at that creature, and suppose it possible if you can.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He does look very hot, to be sure.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
