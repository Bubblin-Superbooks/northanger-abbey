<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;My dear Miss Morland,&rdquo; said Henry, &ldquo;in this amiable solicitude for your brother&rsquo;s comfort, may you not be a little mistaken? Are you not carried a little too far? Would he thank you, either on his own account or Miss Thorpe&rsquo;s, for supposing that her affection, or at least her good behaviour, is only to be secured by her seeing nothing of Captain Tilney? Is he safe only in solitude? Or is her heart constant to him only when unsolicited by anyone else? He cannot think this&mdash;and you may be sure that he would not have you think it. I will not say, &lsquo;Do not be uneasy,&rsquo; because I know that you are so, at this moment; but be as little uneasy as you can.</p></div> </div>
