<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> To ease her mind, and ascertain by the opinion of an unprejudiced person what her own conduct had really been, she took occasion to mention before Mr. Allen the half-settled scheme of her brother and the Thorpes for the following day. Mr. Allen caught at it directly. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and do you think of going too?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No; I had just engaged myself to walk with Miss Tilney before they told me of it; and therefore you know I could not go with them, could I?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, certainly not; and I am glad you do not think of it. These schemes are not at all the thing. Young men and women driving about the country in open carriages! Now and then it is very well; but going to inns and public places together! It is not right; and I wonder Mrs. Thorpe should allow it.</p></div> </div>
