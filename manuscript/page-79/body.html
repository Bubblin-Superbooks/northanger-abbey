But do not tell me&mdash;I would not be told upon any account. I know it must be a skeleton, I am sure it is Laurentina&rsquo;s skeleton. Oh! I am delighted with the book! I should like to spend my whole life in reading it. I assure you, if it had not been to meet you, I would not have come away from it for all the world.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
