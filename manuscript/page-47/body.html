My dear madam, I am not so ignorant of young ladies&rsquo; ways as you wish to believe me; it is this delightful habit of journaling which largely contributes to form the easy style of writing for which ladies are so generally celebrated. Everybody allows that the talent of writing agreeable letters is peculiarly female. Nature may have done something, but I am sure it must be essentially assisted by the practice of keeping a journal.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I have sometimes thought,&rdquo; said Catherine, doubtingly, &ldquo;whether ladies do write so much better letters than gentlemen! That is&mdash;I should not think the superiority was always on our side.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
