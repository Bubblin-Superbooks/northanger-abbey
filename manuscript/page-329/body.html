There never was a young woman so beloved as you are by everybody that knows you; and I dare say when Mr. Morland sees you, my dear child&mdash;but do not let us distress our dear Catherine by talking of such things. Mr. Morland has behaved so very handsome, you know. I always heard he was a most excellent man; and you know, my dear, we are not to suppose but what, if you had had a suitable fortune, he would have come down with something more, for I am sure he must be a most liberal-minded man.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
