I have read all Mrs. Radcliffe&rsquo;s works, and most of them with great pleasure. The Mysteries of Udolpho, when I had once begun it, I could not lay down again; I remember finishing it in two days&mdash;my hair standing on end the whole time.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; added Miss Tilney, &ldquo;and I remember that you undertook to read it aloud to me, and that when I was called away for only five minutes to answer a note, instead of waiting for me, you took the volume into the Hermitage Walk, and I was obliged to stay till you had finished it.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
