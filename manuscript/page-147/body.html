He is a very temperate man, and you could not fancy him in liquor last night?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Lord help you! You women are always thinking of men&rsquo;s being in liquor. Why, you do not suppose a man is overset by a bottle? I am sure of this&mdash;that if everybody was to drink their bottle a day, there would not be half the disorders in the world there are now. It would be a famous good thing for us all.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I cannot believe it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh! Lord, it would be the saving of thousands. There is not the hundredth part of the wine consumed in this kingdom that there ought to be. Our foggy climate wants help.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
