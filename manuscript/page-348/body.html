<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Catherine, with all the earnestness of truth, expressed her astonishment at such a charge, protesting her innocence of every thought of Mr. Thorpe&rsquo;s being in love with her, and the consequent impossibility of her having ever intended to encourage him. &ldquo;As to any attentions on his side, I do declare, upon my honour, I never was sensible of them for a moment&mdash;except just his asking me to dance the first day of his coming. And as to making me an offer, or anything like it, there must be some unaccountable mistake. I could not have misunderstood a thing of that kind, you know! And, as I ever wish to be believed, I solemnly protest that no syllable of such a nature ever passed between us. The last half hour before he went away! It must be all and completely a mistake&mdash;for I did not see him once that whole morning.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
